                    With Java as my core programming strength, I’ve developed applications that are not just efficient but also scalable and maintainable. I’m particularly drawn to the challenge of transforming ideas into user-friendly interfaces, always keeping performance and accessibility at the heart of my process. My experience also spans multimedia systems, animation principles, and e-commerce workflows, which further enrich my development toolkit. From debugging deployment pipelines to automating Word documents with Java libraries,
